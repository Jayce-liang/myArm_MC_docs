# Install driver

Users can click the button below to download the corresponding **CP210X** or **CP34X** driver compressed package according to the operating system they are using. After decompressing the compressed package, select the installation package corresponding to the bit number of the operating system to install.

There are currently two driver chip versions, **CP210X** (applicable to CP2104 version) and **CP34X** (applicable to CH9102 version) driver compressed package. If you are not sure which USB chip your device uses, you can install both drivers at the same time. (**CH9102_VCP_SER_MacOS** An error may occur during the installation process, but it has actually been installed. Just ignore it.)

For Mac OS, make sure your system "Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General" and allow access from the App Store and Approved Developers before installation.
