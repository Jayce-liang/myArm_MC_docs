# 3 Structural installation and fixing

myArm weighs 3.2kg. Since the centre of gravity changes as the robot moves during use, it is required that the robot be fixed on a sturdy base from the outset. Either a fixed base or a mobile base is possible.

## 3.1 graphic guide

### Basic Interface Dimensions

- The base mounting holes are the interface between the robot and other bases or planes. The holes are shown below. There are 4 countersunk holes with a diameter of 4.5 mm that can be secured with M6 bolts.

<img src="../../resources/3-BasicSettings/4-FirstTimeInstallation/4.3 -PowerOnDetectionGuide/底座尺寸.jpg" alt="img-1" width="800" height=“auto” /> <br>

- The end mounts have flanges that are compatible with LEGO component holes and threaded holes. Ensure the appropriate threaded holes are present in the fixing base before installation.

### _Before installing, please make sure:_

- Environmental conditions meet the requirements listed in section 2.2.4.3.1 above. 
- The mounting position is not smaller than the working range of the robot and has sufficient space for installation, use, maintenance and repair. 
- Place the base in a suitable position.
- Prepare tools related to installation, such as screws and spanners. 
- After confirming the above steps, move the robot to the base mounting table, adjust the robot position, and align the fixing holes in the robot base with the holes in the base mounting table. After aligning the holes, align the screws with the holes and tighten them.

> **CAUTION:** When adjusting the robot's position on the base mounting table, do not push or pull the robot directly on the base mounting table as this may cause scratches. When manually moving the robot, do not apply external force to the vulnerable parts of the body to avoid unnecessary damage to the robot.

- Once the robot is installed, it is ready for cable connection and use.

# 4 External cable connection

## 4.1 graphic guide

Before operation, make sure you have read **Chapter 3 Safety Instructions** to ensure safe operation. Meanwhile, connect the power adapter to the robot arm and fix the robot arm base on the table.

The myArm must be powered by an external power supply to provide adequate power:

- Rated Voltage: 24V

- Rated current: 9.4A

- Plug Type: R7B

  ![image-20220620175457856](../../resources/3-BasicSettings/4-FirstTimeInstallation/4.3%20-PowerOnDetectionGuide/R7B.png)

**Please note that it is not possible to use only the plug-in TypeC power supply.** Please use an officially approved power supply to avoid damaging the arm.

The use case diagram is shown below: (Please align the use case diagram carefully for connection)
