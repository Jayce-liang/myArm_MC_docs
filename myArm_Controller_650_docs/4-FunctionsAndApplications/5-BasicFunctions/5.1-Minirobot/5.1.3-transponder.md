# Communication forwarding

This chapter describes how to use the extended development capabilities of the built-in software. This feature allows you to expand the connectivity options of your devices and supports different development environments and methods.

Currently, communication forwarding only supports USB communication.

**Step 1**: Confirm that Type-C is correctly connected to your device, select Transponder and click OK to enter the communication forwarding interface.
