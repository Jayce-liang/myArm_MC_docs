The MyArm C650 version comes with the miniRoboflow application software developed independently by Elephant Robotics. Functions such as drag-and-drop teaching, communication forwarding, status checking and zero calibration can be achieved through simple push-button interaction. The user interface of the built-in software is simple and easy to use. The communication forwarding function allows you to control the robot using a variety of programming languages and development environments, making robot control easy.
